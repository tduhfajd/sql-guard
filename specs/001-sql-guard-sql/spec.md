# Feature Specification: SQL-Guard Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-sql-guard-sql`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "–ü–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ–µ –≤–µ–±-–ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ SQL-Guard –¥–ª—è –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è SQL –∫ PostgreSQL –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ä–µ–¥–µ..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a Database Operator**, I want to safely execute SQL queries against production PostgreSQL databases so that I can perform data analysis and troubleshooting while maintaining security and compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a Viewer user, **When** I write a SELECT query, **Then** the system automatically applies LIMIT and timeout, and blocks any DDL/DML operations
2. **Given** I am an Operator user, **When** I execute an approved SQL template with parameters, **Then** the query runs successfully with parameter substitution
3. **Given** I am an Approver user, **When** I review a pending SQL template, **Then** I can approve or reject it with comments
4. **Given** I am an Admin user, **When** I manage user roles and database access, **Then** changes take effect immediately
5. **Given** any user executes a query, **When** the query completes, **Then** PII data is masked in results and logs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a query exceeds the statement timeout?
- How does the system handle SQL injection attempts?
- What occurs when a user tries to access unauthorized databases/schemas?
- How are failed queries logged and reported?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide role-based access control with four distinct roles (Viewer, Operator, Approver, Admin)
- **FR-002**: System MUST restrict Viewer users to SELECT-only queries with automatic LIMIT and timeout enforcement
- **FR-003**: System MUST block DDL/DML operations for Viewer users with clear error messages
- **FR-004**: System MUST support SQL template creation with parameter substitution for Operator users
- **FR-005**: System MUST require approval workflow for templates before production execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide approval queue interface for Approver users with SQL preview
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit log of all SQL executions and user actions
- **FR-008**: System MUST support audit log filtering and export functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically mask PII data in query results and logs
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide user management interface for Admin users
- **FR-011**: System MUST support database and schema access control configuration
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce security policies (statement_timeout, max_rows, auto_limit)
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent UPDATE/DELETE operations without WHERE clauses
- **FR-014**: System MUST detect and log security violation attempts
- **FR-015**: System MUST support template versioning and change tracking

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents system users with roles, permissions, and authentication credentials
- **SQL Template**: Parameterized SQL queries with versioning, approval status, and metadata
- **Approval Request**: Pending template approvals with reviewer assignments and comments
- **Audit Log**: Immutable record of all system activities, queries, and security events
- **Database Connection**: Secure connection configurations with access policies
- **Security Policy**: Rules governing query execution, timeouts, and access restrictions
