# SQL Guard Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Design
Every feature MUST prioritize SQL security and protection; Security considerations are non-negotiable and MUST be validated before any implementation; All SQL operations MUST be sanitized, validated, and monitored for potential vulnerabilities.

### II. CLI Interface
Every security feature exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats for security reports and analysis.

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Security tests MUST cover all attack vectors and edge cases.

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: SQL injection prevention, Query validation, Database connection security, Schema analysis, Performance under attack scenarios.

### V. Observability & Monitoring
Structured logging required for all security events; Audit trails MUST be maintained for all SQL operations; Performance monitoring MUST detect anomalies and potential attacks.

## Security Requirements

All SQL operations MUST be validated against known attack patterns; Input sanitization is mandatory for all user-provided data; Database connections MUST use secure protocols and authentication; Security vulnerabilities MUST be reported immediately with severity classification.

## Development Workflow

Code review requirements: Security-focused review for all SQL-related code; Testing gates: All security tests MUST pass before deployment; Deployment approval: Security team approval required for production releases; Documentation: Security procedures MUST be documented and kept current.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require security team documentation, approval, and migration plan; All PRs/reviews MUST verify security compliance; Complexity MUST be justified with security benefits; Use development guidelines for runtime development guidance.
